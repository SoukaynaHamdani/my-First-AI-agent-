An advanced, multi-tool AI agent designed to provide accurate and context-aware answers by intelligently choosing between a private knowledge base and a live web search.  

## The Problem

Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) face two major limitations:
1.  **Knowledge Cutoff:** They lack information about events that occurred after their training date.
2.  **Lack of Specialization:** They cannot provide deep, authoritative answers based on private or domain-specific documents.
3.  **API Costs:** Foundational tasks like creating text embeddings can be cost-prohibitive for large documents, quickly exhausting API quotas.

This project solves all three problems by creating an agent that can reason about a user's query, select the appropriate tool, and leverage free, local, open-source models for heavy-lifting tasks.

## How It Works

The Smart Research Agent is built on a "Zero-shot ReAct" framework, allowing it to reason and decide on a sequence of actions. It has access to two specialized tools:

1.  **Local Knowledge Base (The Expert):**
    *   **Technology:** This tool is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
    *   **Process:** It ingests a domain-specific PDF (the seminal AI paper "Attention Is All You Need"), processes it into a searchable vector index using FAISS, and uses it to answer deep technical questions.
    *   **Key Optimization:** To eliminate API costs and quota limits, this pipeline uses a high-performance, open-source `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) that runs locally.

2.  **Google Web Search (The Journalist):**
    *   **Technology:** This tool leverages the Google Search API via SerpAPI.
    *   **Process:** It takes a query, searches the live internet, and returns up-to-date information.
    *   **Use Case:** Perfect for questions about recent events, current affairs, or any topic outside the scope of the local knowledge base.

The agent's "brain" (powered by OpenAI's LLM) analyzes the user's question and writes a "thought" about which tool is best suited to answer it before taking action.

## Key Features & Technical Highlights

*   **Agentic Logic:** The agent autonomously decides which tool to use based on the query's context.
*   **Hybrid Model Approach:** Strategically uses a paid OpenAI LLM for high-level reasoning and a free, local embedding model for the data-intensive task of document indexing, creating a cost-effective and powerful solution.
 
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Demonstrates the ability to build a system that grounds LLM responses in factual, verifiable document sources.
*   **Verbose Reasoning:** The agent is set to `verbose=True` to print its chain of thought, providing full transparency into its decision-making process.
